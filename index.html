    <p> <H1>I am a poet, a photographer, and an innovative artist with a mission, to turn adversity into inspiration.

        Today, I stand among the top 200 out of 20,000 poets—a testament to the transformative power of creativity and resilience. My poetry resonates deeply because it is born from a journey of turning pain into profound love. This dedication earned me the title of 2012’s Best Poet, a milestone that reflects my commitment to channeling my experiences into art.
        
        I am the founder of Art By Tovias, an art company that embodies my vision, and Lanky Bois, a clothing brand that represents a blend of creativity and individuality. These ventures are more than businesses; they are symbols of my relentless pursuit of dreams despite life's challenges.
        
        My journey has been marked, by hard-earned lessons and unyielding perseverance. The path to success, I learned, is paved with unwavering effort and a refusal to seek shortcuts. Through immense personal trials, including the heart-wrenching loss of a child to S.I.D.S., I faced profound sorrow and depression. Yet, it was in those darkest moments that I discovered a lifeline—my pen. Choosing to write rather than succumb to despair became my salvation, guiding me through the storm and enabling me to achieve a GED and an AA degree even while homeless.
